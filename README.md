# Stair Height Calculator

A simple yet practical web tool for solving uneven stair height issues during construction.

## Background

In building construction, uniform stair step heights are crucial for user comfort and safety. However, due to various reasons (such as measurement errors, construction deviations, etc.), actual built stairs may have uneven heights. When adjusting these errors, several factors need to be considered:

1. How to adjust uneven height differences to a uniform value
2. How to minimize modifications to existing structures
3. How to ensure the effectiveness of adjustments

## Features

- **Real-time Calculation**: Get adjustment suggestions immediately after data input
- **Bottom-up Algorithm**: Uses a "bottom-up displacement" calculation method to ensure feasibility
- **Simple Interface**: Clear design, easy to operate
- **No Installation**: Pure browser application, ready to use
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes
- **Multi-language Support**: Available in Chinese, English, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage
2. Input the current height difference for each step
3. The system will automatically calculate:
   - Ideal average height difference
   - Specific adjustment amount needed for each step (+ for increase, - for decrease)

## Why Open Source?

This project is open-sourced for the following purposes:

1. **Serve Construction Industry**: Provide a convenient calculation tool for construction sites
2. **Share Technology**: Demonstrate how to solve practical problems with simple web technology
3. **Open Improvement**: Welcome community contributions to enhance the tool
